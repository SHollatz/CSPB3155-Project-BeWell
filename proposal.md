### Project: Be Well!
#### Team members' names
<ul>
<li>Amanda Killen</li>
<li>Anthony Pearo</li>
<li>Julie Kirkpatrick</li>
<li>Sabine Hollatz</li>
</ul>

#### Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
Your health matters. Stay informed about the potential contacts you make during travel, so you can stay healthy and stay on the job. You will be able to self-submit data on details of your flight and symptoms or diagnoses. With our web application, you can easily provide healthcare providers with information on exposure to non-domestic strains/illnesses and search through other user submitted data. You can even sign up to get notified on health updates for your recent flights.

#### Motivation: why are you working on this project?
<ul>
<li>Thereâ€™s a global pandemic.</li>
<li>Travel has always posed a risk to health - tropical diseases, flu, even a cold.</li>
<li>The world is more connected than ever before, and with this new degree of connection comes an elevated risk for exposure to new diseases.</li>
<li>
This may only be the first global pandemic so we have to prepare ourselves and our 
structures. A higher degree of individual resilience and responsibility is required for business and travel to continue in this rapidly changing world</li>
</ul>



#### Risks to project completion:
<ul>
<li>New language or working environment</li>
<li>No prior experience working with these team members</li>
<li>Not knowing how all the pieces connect (hosting, database, user interface, etc.)</li>
<li>Project scope can quickly get out of hand </li>
<li>Authenticity of information</li>
</ul>


####Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
<ul>
<li>Using clear communication for help with tasks</li>
<li>Building small pieces first and iterating on those</li>
<li>Using online tutorials for different web development</li>
<li>Working software prioritized over end-project</li>
<li>User profiles</li>
</ul>


#### Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
<ul>
<li>Kanban via Trello for story and task management</li>
<li>Weekly Scrum meetings (Mondays via Zoom)</li>

<li>Scrum Master: Amanda Killeen</li>
<li>Sprint Length: 1 week</li>
</ul>
