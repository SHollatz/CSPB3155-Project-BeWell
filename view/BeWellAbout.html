        <h4>About BeWell</h4>
		<div>
<p>In the midst of a global pandemic, contact tracing is more important than ever. The world was temporarily put on pause, but now that flights are once again running, we here at BeWell think that <b>you</b> should have the power to contribute to a more whole understanding of when and where diseases make themselves known. </p>
<h6>Enter our tool: A web application built on the principle of citizen science! </h6>
<p>The idea is simple: Have you been on a flight and now feel ill?</p>
<p>After flying, if you feel ill, simply enter your information into our database, and now anyone on that flight can compare and trace symptoms and illnesses across international borders. </p>
<p>This includes <b>you</b>! You have access to othersâ€™ data on their flights and symptoms.  Our algorithms will even assign a status to effortlessly alert you the severity of illness on any given flight. Searching for answers has never been easier.</p>
<p>The more who self-report, the more robust our database becomes, and the easier it is to find out from where you caught that nasty bug.</p>
<h6 style = "color:#4b94e9;"> More information. Better outcomes. Be Well.</h6>
